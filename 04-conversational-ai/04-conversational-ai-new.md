# Lab 4 - Conversational AI with Azure Bot Service and Cognitive Services

This lab covers Power Virtual Agents as the hero bot service and demonstrates how to use Copilot option to create bot.

## Task 1 - Explore dashboard of COVID-19 data

Understanding the source datasets is very important in AI and ML. To help you expedite the process, we have created a Power BI dashboard you can use to explore them at the beginning of each lab.

![Azure AI in a Day datasets](./media/SHC1.png)

To get more details about the source datasets, check out the [Data Overview](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/ai-in-a-day/blob/main/data-overview.md) section.

To explore the dashboard of COVID-19 data, open the `Azure-AI-in-a-Day-Data-Overview` file located on the desktop (**C:\Users\public\desktop**) ðŸ’» of the virtual machine provided with your environment. If you see `Introducing the updated mobile layout` popup screen, then close it by click on `Got it`. Collapse the **Fields** and **Visualizations** tabs to see the clear report.

> **Note:** Please close and reopen the Power BI Desktop document if it throws an error in the first attempt.

## Task 2 - Explore lab scenario

The power of Machine Learning also comes into play when dealing with human-to-machine interfaces. While classical interfaces like native or web applications are ubiquitous, the new approaches based on conversational AI are becoming increasingly popular. Having the capability to interact with intelligent services using natural language is quickly becoming the norm rather than the exception. Using Conversational AI, analysts can find the research of interest by using simple natural language phrases.

With Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), Human Machine Interface (HMI) technologies are enjoying an increased adoption year over year. By 2021, [the growth of chatbots in this space is expected to be 25.07%](https://www.technavio.com/report/chatbot-market-industry-analysis).


The way organizations are building conversational systems is evolving, with bots being built and maintained by a mix of technical and non-technical roles. Power Virtual Agents has the capability to extend its capabilities by allowing pro-code users to create dialogs / topics using the Azure Bot Framework Composer today. This experience allows technical and non-technical teams to build and host their solutions on a single platform.

## Task 5 - Create an adaptive card using Bot Framework Composer

1. When Bot Framework Composer application launches, you will be prompted to sign in. Sign in with the provided credentials.

   >**Note**: You can find the credentials in the environment details tab.

2. Once you sign in, you will be asked to import your bot to a new project. The **Name** field will be auto-populated. If it's empty, fill the name field with the name of your bot **AI-Bot-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)** which you created on the **Power virtual agents** page. Then, click **Create (2)**.

   ![](media/import-bot.1.png)

    ![](media/publish-bot-02.png)  

14. You will get a confirmation message in Composer once the bot has been published.

    ![](media/publish-bot-03.png) 

## Task 6 - Add your composer content to Power Virtual Agents bot

1. Go back to the **Power Virtual Agents** page.

2. On the **Topics** tab notice the adaptive card action you just published from Composer is visible in your list of topics. 

   >**Note**: You may need to refresh the screen your page to see it.

3. Open the topic: **Meal delivery options**.

   ![](media/select-mdo.png)

4. Click on **+** to add a node at the bottom of the Topic. Then select **Redirect to another topic (1)** and select **Meals (2)**.

   ![](media/redirect-another-topic.1.png)

5. Your Power Virtual Agents bot will call the Bot Framework dialog to display an adaptive card. Click on **Save** icon at the top right.

   ![](media/lab3-task6-step5.png)

## Task 7 - Test your Bot

1. While on the **Meal delivery options**, select the **Bot** icon on the top right corner.

   ![](media/test-bot.png)

2. In the Test bot pane, enable the **Track between topics**.

   ![](media/track-between-topics.png)

3. Enter the below phrase in a trigger phrase in Test bot. 

   ```what meals can I order```

   ![](media/lab3-task7-step3.png)

4. Then enter the name of the city as **Seattle**. Your chatbot should display images of the meals in an adaptive card as show below.

   ![](media/final-bot.png)

Now you have successfully created and tested Power Virtual Agents bot
